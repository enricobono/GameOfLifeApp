      is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each cell is in one of two
      possible states, live or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-inside list-disc">
      <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation</li>
      <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation</li>
      <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives</li>
      <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Click on any cell to start playing (or load a random map if you are <i>that</i> tired)! ðŸ˜Š
