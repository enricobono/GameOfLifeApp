# My game of life

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up your local development environment:

 - Start the backend application
 - Navigate to the root of the Nuxt application.
 - Install the dependencies by running `yarn install`.
 - Duplicate the `.env.example` file and save it as `.env`. Edit the `API_URL` to match the URL of your local Laravel application. By default, it should be `http://localhost:8000/api`.
 - Initiate the Nuxt development process by running `yarn dev`.
